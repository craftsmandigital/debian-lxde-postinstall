Installing tasks

	Issues
	1.	My computer could not connect to the wireless network during installation
		Maybee my computer has a spessial network card.
		The solution to this problem vas to use a non-free disrubution of debian.
		I downloaded it from this link WWW and burned it to a DVD.
	2.	When the installaton was finnished, I could not manage to connect to the internett.
		The fix to that problem was to follow these WWW instructions on the last screen of
		the installation. The heading of this step is "Finish the install"

	The instalation prosess is pretty stright forward. exept three things
	1.	When you come to the point where you is asked to type inn password for super/root user.
		Leave these blank and go to next step. When you do this a sudo configuration is created for you
		automaticly. If you need a super/root user later on, you can configure that later.
	2.	When you came to the screen where to select software. Leave it as it is, exept give a hock for LXDE
	3.	Read carefully above step 2. under Issues. WWW

	Run the install script

	Manualy task to do after post install
	1.	Configure Personal Google chrome
		1.	press <SUPER> + g Google chrome could now start
